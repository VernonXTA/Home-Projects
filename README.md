## Overview

This portfolio reflects my passion for cybersecurity and my dedication to mastering the defensive side of the field. Through self-driven projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with concepts like network monitoring, vulnerability assessment, and threat intelligence gathering. Each project is documented to showcase the steps, tools, and outcomes.

## Projects

### 1. Honeypot Deployment and Threat Intelligence

**Objective:** To gather threat intelligence by deploying a honeypot and monitoring attack patterns.  
**Steps Taken:**
- Configured a [honeypot tool] to simulate vulnerable services.
- Analyzed malicious traffic using Splunk and Wireshark.
- Logged attack patterns to identify common techniques used by attackers.
- Automated monitoring and alerting mechanisms.

**Outcome:** Collected valuable insights into real-world attack vectors, improving understanding of threat actor behavior.

### 2. Nmap XMAS Scan Detection and Mitigation

**Objective:** To detect and block an Nmap XMAS scan targeting a web server.  
**Steps Taken:**
- Identified the XMAS scan targeting port 80 on an Apache2 web server.
- Configured `iptables` to dynamically block the attacker’s IP address.
- Hardened the server by dropping malformed and stealthy packets.
- Verified the mitigation using testing tools.

**Outcome:** Successfully mitigated the attack, ensuring server availability and security.

### 3. SCADA System Security Design

**Objective:** To design a secure architecture for SCADA systems in the water treatment industry.  
**Steps Taken:**
- Developed a Level 4 business-side SCADA design, integrating secure communication protocols.
- Incorporated CRM and data recovery solutions for business continuity.
- Analyzed potential vulnerabilities and proposed mitigation strategies.

**Outcome:** Created a robust design framework for securing industrial control systems.

### 4. Packet Tracer Network Configurations

**Objective:** To design and implement efficient network configurations using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
**Steps Taken:**
- Created VLSM addressing schemes for optimized IP allocation.
- Configured IPv6 on network devices to support modern communication standards.
- Tested connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute` to ensure a resilient setup.

**Outcome:** Achieved a well-structured network with minimal latency and high reliability.

## Tools and Technologies

Throughout these projects, I’ve worked with:
- **Security Tools:** Splunk, Wireshark, iptables
- **Networking Tools:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Virtualization:** VMware
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu), Windows Server
